# LISA_ET

There is a lot in here, with not a lot annotated. So good luck!
## Data files
Rtab is the data file for LISA and ciao4 is the data file for ET.

## Sensitivity curve scripts
Each type of curve has its own script: PLS, BPLS, LogNs. The BPLS script will take a very very long time to run ~ hours


## Fisher Matrix
Fisher Matrix scripts do what they say on the tin and calc the elements of the fisher matrices and then plot the getdist plots.
